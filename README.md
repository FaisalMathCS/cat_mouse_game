# Cat and Mouse Graph Game

I saw this game on [twitter](https://x.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1906017463461908841)
I wanted to check if the mouse is doomed in this case LOL and it was. 
the graph is fixed but the algorithm is generic for different kinds of graphs 
the starting possition for the cat and the mouse is passed as an argument, if nothing is passed then a default of A for moues and E for cat.
